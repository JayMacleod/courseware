## Overview

**Cloud security** sometimes referred as **Cloud computing security** is made up of *sets of policies*, *controls*, *procedures* and *technologies* that all work together for the purpose of protecting cloud based systems, infrastructure and data.

Configuration of these security measures is for:
- protecting data
- complying with regulations
- ensuring customer privacy
- enforcing authentication for individual devices or users

Cloud security is flexible, what this means is that it will support your business needs, you might need authentication, or traffic filtering and it would be supported.

The configuration of security is done in one place, this reduces the overhead for staff spending time on it, where the extra time can be spent somewhere else for the business benefit.

How the cloud security is delivered depends from what is the solution and which cloud provider is used.

Additionally it's not a sole responsibility of the business to implement it, but a joint effort with the cloud provider involved.

## Why is cloud security important?

With the current trend of businesses moving their services to the cloud, robust security becomes imperative.

Just how security measures evolve, people that try to break them don't stand still either, both sides are in a constant battle of evolving and trying to take over each other.

It's not like moving to the cloud will make your application more secure than on-premises, this is where security configurations comes into play and that will be what determines how secure your company will be.

These are the benefits that cloud security offers:
- **centralized security**
- **reduced costs**
- **reduced administration**
- **reliability**

### Centralised security

Moving your services to the cloud centralizes them, at the same time security is also centralized in one place.

On premises network would have numerous devices and endpoints, that still is the case once everything is in the cloud.

The bigger difference comes from it all being in one place, it becomes easier to analyse traffic and filtering, additionally monitoring of networking and policy updates becomes a more streamlined process.

A big benefit is that you can configure your services for disaster recovery as everything is in one place.

### Cost effectiveness

A big benefit of using cloud storage and security services is that there is no need to spend up-front cost for hardware.

This reduces capital expense at the same time reducing administrative overhead.

IT teams used to fight fight with security issues reactively (once they appear), where in the cloud it's more about proactive security (before they appear) that is running 24/7 without any need for human intervention.

### Reduced administration

Once your services are with a reputable cloud provider, there will be no more manual security configurations or constant security updates.

These tasks are not only massive time drain but also adds a bit load on resources.

This is taken away once you move to the cloud as all of the security is defined and controlled in one place.

### Reliability

It wouldn't be an understatement to say that cloud services provide the best dependability out there.

The only caveat being that the right security measure need to be in place and configured correctly.

Once that step is done, users can then safely have access to their data and application in the cloud.

The trend of moving to the cloud is there for a reason, what businesses are noticing is that moving their services to the cloud gives them many benefits.

These benefits include things like: *scaling*, *reduced costs*, *using agile systems*.

One thing businesses need to ensure is that they have complete confidence in the security that they implemented and that the systems are secure of threats like: *data theft*, *leakage*, *deletion* and *corruption*.

It doesn't matter whether you're using public, private, hybrid cloud models, they are all susceptible to IT threads is mishandled.

That is why businesses are cautious of moving their systems to the cloud, but the same threats can happen on on-premises infrastructure, hence everything boils down to how the security is implemented and managed.
