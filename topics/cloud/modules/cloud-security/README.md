## Overview

**Cloud security** sometimes referred as **Cloud computing security** is made up of *sets of policies*, *controls*, *procedures* and *technologies* that all work together for the purpose of protecting cloud based systems, infrastructure and data.

Configuration of these security measures is for:
- protecting data
- complying with regulations
- ensuring customer privacy
- enforcing authentication for individual devices or users

Cloud security is flexible, what this means is that it will support your business needs, you might need authentication, or traffic filtering and it would be supported.

The configuration of security is done in one place, this reduces the overhead for staff spending time on it, where the extra time can be spent somewhere else for the business benefit.

How the cloud security is delivered depends from what is the solution and which cloud provider is used.

Additionally it's not a sole responsibility of the business to implement it, but a joint effort with the cloud provider involved.
