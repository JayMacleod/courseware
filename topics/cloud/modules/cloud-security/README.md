## Overview

**Cloud security** sometimes referred as **Cloud computing security** is made up of *sets of policies*, *controls*, *procedures* and *technologies* that all work together for the purpose of protecting cloud based systems, infrastructure and data.

Configuration of these security measures is for:
- protecting data
- complying with regulations
- ensuring customer privacy
- enforcing authentication for individual devices or users

Cloud security is flexible, what this means is that it will support your business needs, you might need authentication, or traffic filtering and it would be supported.

The configuration of security is done in one place, this reduces the overhead for staff spending time on it, where the extra time can be spent somewhere else for the business benefit.

How the cloud security is delivered depends from what is the solution and which cloud provider is used.

Additionally it's not a sole responsibility of the business to implement it, but a joint effort with the cloud provider involved.

## Why is cloud security important?

With the current trend of businesses moving their services to the cloud, robust security becomes imperative.

Just how security measures evolve, people that try to break them don't stand still either, both sides are in a constant battle of evolving and trying to take over each other.

It's not like moving to the cloud will make your application more secure than on-premises, this is where security configurations comes into play and that will be what determines how secure your company will be.

These are the benefits that cloud security offers:
- **centralized security**
- **reduced costs**
- **reduced administration**
- **reliability**

### Centralised security

Moving your services to the cloud centralizes them, at the same time security is also centralized in one place.

On premises network would have numerous devices and endpoints, that still is the case once everything is in the cloud.

The bigger difference comes from it all being in one place, it becomes easier to analyse traffic and filtering, additionally monitoring of networking and policy updates becomes a more streamlined process.

A big benefit is that you can configure your services for disaster recovery as everything is in one place.
