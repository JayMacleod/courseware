# Hybrid cloud

## Overview

Hybrid cloud is a combination of *Public cloud* and *Private cloud* and allows data or applications to be shared between them.

One way to use hybrid cloud is that you would keep basic and non-sensitive tasks on the public cloud, while business-critical data or applications would remain private.

You can think of *Hybrid cloud* as a master of all trades, as you get all the benefits of *Public cloud*, without giving up your security which allows you to make sure you are not in the risk of data exposure.

### Pros

One of the advantages is that when the computing demand fluctuates, by using hybrid cloud you would have the ability to scale seamlessly your on-site infrastructure, without giving third party provider access to your data. 

Pros can be summed up as:
- greater flexibility
- resilience to outages
- no capacity ceiling
- manageable security

### Cons

There are some cons like:
- higher capital expenditure up-front
- under-utilization of resources risk
- higher ongoing costs
- more maintenance required
- risk of compatibility issues

### Best for

*Hybrid cloud* is best for:
- transitioning to the cloud
- systems that need enhanced security
- systems that require data or applications on-premises
