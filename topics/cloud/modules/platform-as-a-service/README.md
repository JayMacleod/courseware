### Description

Platform as a Service is an environment in the cloud with all the resources you need for development or deployment of cloud based applications.

The resources are purchased on pay-as-you go basis, where access to them is granted through a secure internet connection.

**PaaS** includes *IaaS* services with the addition of: 
- middleware
- development tools
- business intelligence services
- database management systems

With *PaaS* you would avoid the hassle of paying for and managing things like:
- software licenses
- application infrastructure
- middleware
- container orchestration
- development tools

The main responsibilities that are left in the users hands are the application and services that you're developing while everything else is the responsibility of the cloud provider.
