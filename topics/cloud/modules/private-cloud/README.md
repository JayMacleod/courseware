## Overview

**Private cloud** is defined as computing services available to selected users only and accessible over the internet or internal network.

*Private cloud* has all the capabilities of *Public cloud* with the addition of *control* and *customization*. 

There are two cloud models that can be delivered via *Private cloud*:
- **IaaS**
- **PaaS**

Similarly the two cloud models can be combined into *Hybrid cloud*.

Additional points worth mentioning:
- single tenant implementation
- owned and operated by IT organisation
- define your own data management policies 
- self-service and automation capabilities provide new agility

### Security

Security is a level higher compared to the *Public cloud* counterpart, what this entails is that not only the third party providers security is used but additionally the companies security practices can also be implemented.

All of these security practices are in place so that the sensitive data is not accessible to third party provider.

### Pros

Most noteworthy pros are:
- fully customizable
- higher level of security
- better performance

### Cons

Some of the cons:
- higher up-front capital expense
- risk of under-utilizing resources
- higher ongoing costs
- more maintenance required

An additional drawback is that the companies IT department is held responsible for the cost and accountability of *Private cloud*.

Hence, private cloud requires the same staff, management, expenses and maintenance like a on premises solution.

### Best for

Here are some of the best business cases:
- highly secure systems or applications
- systems that require customization
