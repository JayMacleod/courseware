# Description

**SaaS** allows everyone to connect to the cloud based application over the internet. 

Common examples of SaaS application would be: Gmail, Netflix, Office 365 wtc.

*SaaS* is similarly a pay-to-go service that allows you to obtain a complete software solution from the chosen cloud provider. 

In simple words, you are able to rent an application, which you or your users are then able to access through the internet. 

Everything from infrastructure to data is stored in the providers data centre.

Service provider is responsible for managing everything from availability, hardware, software, security, data etc.

### Business case

One of the best examples is an email application you have most likely already used or are using. 

Most likely the application you are using is a SaaS.

With this service you are able to log on from anywhere in the world, access your emails from a browser, mobile app, tablet or any other device that has internet connection

The software itself is stored by the provider in some data centre, similarly your data is most likely there as well.

You don't have to concern yourself where it is all stored, what you care the most is about having the application running and being able to use it.

This example refers more to a personal use case.

A business case is similar, where you gain access to services that allow your team to collaborate, use emails, send messages, store data, manage calendar events. 

More advanced application for bussiness would include services for **C**ustomer **R**elationship **M**anagement (**CRM**), **E**nterprise **R**esource **P**lanning (**ERP**).

Business case is more likely to be a subscription based service, or based on some level of usage.
