### Business case

One of the best examples is an email application you have most likely already used or are using. 

Most likely the application you are using is a SaaS.

With this service you are able to log on from anywhere in the world, access your emails from a browser, mobile app, tablet or any other device that has internet connection

The software itself is stored by the provider in some data centre, similarly your data is most likely there as well.

You don't have to concern yourself where it is all stored, what you care the most is about having the application running and being able to use it.

This example refers more to a personal use case.

A business case is similar, where you gain access to services that allow your team to collaborate, use emails, send messages, store data, manage calendar events. 

More advanced application for bussiness would include services for **C**ustomer **R**elationship **M**anagement (**CRM**), **E**nterprise **R**esource **P**lanning (**ERP**).

Business case is more likely to be a subscription based service, or based on some level of usage.
